Welcome to my Memory Game, have fun playing it.

Introduction:

I developed this game as one task of my 
Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

How to play the game:

Like a traditional memory game the goal is to find an
remind pairs of cards.
A shuffeled stack of cards is presented in random order.
You flip over a pair of cards clicking them. 
If the donÂ´t match the flip back over after a short timeout.
If the match the stay with their face open.
Your goal is to find all matching pairs as quick as possible.
The time and the moves you need are tracked and displayed to you.

Go for it!

Dependencies:

The icons on the cards depend on font awsome - which is awsome!

Contributions:

I contribute to the Udacity team for the starter code on which the development is based aswell as the helpful hints I got from the first review of my game.
